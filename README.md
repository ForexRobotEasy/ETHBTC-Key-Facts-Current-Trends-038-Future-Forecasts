# ETHBTC: Key Facts, Current Trends & Future Forecasts

This code is a sample implementation of a Forex trading algorithm that focuses on the ETHBTC currency pair. It uses technical analysis indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands to identify potential trading opportunities. The code fetches the current price data for Ethereum and Bitcoin, performs the technical analysis, and places buy or sell orders based on predefined conditions.

## Development

This code was developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team, a group of experienced Forex traders and developers dedicated to creating efficient and profitable trading algorithms.

## Importing Libraries

The code imports the necessary libraries for trading, series manipulation, and indicator calculations.

## Constants

The code defines two constants, `ETH_SYMBOL` and `BTC_SYMBOL`, which represent the symbols for Ethereum and Bitcoin, respectively. It also defines the `TIMEFRAME` constant, which sets the timeframe for analysis to 1 hour.

## Global Variables

The code defines two global variables, `ethPrice` and `btcPrice`, which store the current prices of Ethereum and Bitcoin, respectively.

## Functions

### FetchPriceData()

This function fetches the price data for Ethereum and Bitcoin using the `CopyRates()` function. It stores the most recent closing prices in the `ethPrice` and `btcPrice` variables.

### PerformTechnicalAnalysis()

This function performs technical analysis on the Ethereum price data. It calculates the short-term and long-term moving averages, the relative strength index (RSI), and the upper and lower Bollinger Bands. Based on predefined conditions, it places buy or sell orders using the `OrderSend()` function.

### OnStart()

This is the entry point of the program. It calls the `FetchPriceData()` and `PerformTechnicalAnalysis()` functions to fetch the price data and perform the technical analysis.
